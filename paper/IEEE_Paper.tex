\begin{abstract}
Matrix multiplication constitutes a fundamental computational kernel within the domains of scientific computing and machine learning. This paper offers a comprehensive performance evaluation of matrix multiplication implementations across four parallel computing paradigms: Sequential (CPU baseline), OpenMP (shared-memory), MPI (distributed-memory), and CUDA (GPU acceleration) on contemporary heterogeneous hardware. We conduct benchmarks of square matrix multiplication for problem sizes ranging from 500×500 to 4000×4000 on a workstation equipped with an Intel Core i5-11400H (6 cores) and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU. Our findings indicate that GPU-accelerated CUDA achieves a 2530× speedup over the sequential CPU implementation in the largest test case, while shared-memory OpenMP and distributed-memory MPI achieve more modest speedups of 3.8× and 3.6×, respectively. We provide a detailed analysis of communication overhead, memory utilization, and computational efficiency, and offer practical guidelines for selecting the appropriate parallelization strategy based on problem characteristics and hardware constraints.

\section{Introduction}


High Performance Computing (HPC) has emerged as a crucial component of contemporary computer science, driven by the need for intricate and large-scale simulations to advance scientific research, artificial intelligence, and various other domains involving data-intensive applications. As scientific workloads grow increasingly complex, the necessity for efficient parallel computing becomes paramount. Matrix multiplication, a fundamental operation in linear algebra, serves as a benchmark for evaluating the efficiency of diverse parallel programming environments and paradigms. Its high arithmetic intensity and consistent memory access patterns exemplify the effectiveness of a parallel programming environment in utilizing hardware resources such as memory.

The advent of multi-core CPUs and general-purpose GPUs has facilitated the creation of diverse parallel programming environments tailored to different hardware architectures and memory models. OpenMP is a widely used programming technique that enables the parallelization of loops and code regions on shared memory multi-core CPU systems through compiler directives. While effective for scaling across processors, it is constrained by shared cache and memory bandwidth limitations. Conversely, the Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a parallel programming model designed for distributed memory systems, where multiple networked computers process data and communicate through a message-driven approach. Although MPI is effective for scaling across nodes, it may experience communication overhead, particularly in tightly coupled problems such as matrix multiplication. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), developed by NVIDIA, is a data-parallel model that leverages thousands of lightweight threads on GPU-based systems to achieve high levels of parallelism and substantial memory bandwidth, which are advantageous for dense linear algebra problems.

Despite their shared objective of reducing execution time through concurrent execution, these frameworks differ fundamentally in their execution and communication models. OpenMP employs threads that share an address space, MPI executables operate in distinct memory spaces and communicate via explicit messages, and CUDA utilizes a hierarchical execution model of blocks and threads within GPU address spaces. Understanding the advantages and limitations of each model is essential for selecting the appropriate model based on the hardware configuration and workload type.

Previous studies, such as those conducted by Al-Mulhem et al. (2013) and Hasta \& Mutiara (2010), have undertaken comparative analyses of OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA implementations of matrix multiplication, highlighting the differences and respective trade-offs in computational-to-communication ratios and scalability. However, the rapid evolution of CPU–GPU architecture and compiler optimizations necessitates an updated comparison and re-evaluation in the context of contemporary hardware and tools. This study is thus motivated to conduct an extensive empirical investigation of OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA implementations of dense matrix multiplication on a modern heterogeneous platform, specifically utilizing a 6-core Intel i5-11400H CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU.

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative comparison of these paradigms in terms of execution time, scalability, and efficiency. By examining similar implementations in sequential, shared-memory, distributed-memory, and GPU-accelerated scenarios under consistent conditions, the study aims to address the following three primary areas of interest:

\begin{itemize}
\item How well do OpenMP and MPI scale on contemporary multi-core processors? 
\item How do CPU parallelized implementations compare with GPU acceleration? 
\item What type of architectural and algorithmic factors dominate the performance in the respective paradigms? 
\end{itemize}

The structure of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 elaborates on the experimental methodology. Section 4 provides a detailed account of the implementation specifics. Section 5 presents an analysis of the results. Section 6 synthesizes the discussion, and Section 7 addresses the conclusion and future research directions.

\section{Related Work}

Matrix multiplication has traditionally served as a fundamental benchmark for assessing the efficacy of parallel programming models, attributed to its consistent data access pattern and substantial computational demands. Initial comparative analyses of shared- and distributed-memory frameworks have indicated that implementation efficiency is significantly influenced by memory architecture and communication mechanisms.

Al-Mulhem \textit{et al.}~\cite{almulhem2013benchmarking} conducted one of the pioneering direct comparisons among OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA implementations of matrix multiplication. Their findings revealed that OpenMP is most effective for moderate matrix sizes on multi-core CPUs, whereas CUDA offers considerable acceleration for large matrices, achieving over $100\times$ speedup relative to the sequential baseline. Hasta and Mutiara~\cite{hasta2010mpiopenmp} examined MPI and OpenMP performance on multi-core systems, reporting that MPI scales efficiently up to a limited number of nodes but becomes communication-bound as inter-process data transfer increases. Their results emphasized the necessity of minimizing synchronization and message-passing overhead in distributed-memory environments.

Singh \textit{et al.}~\cite{singh2019openmp} concentrated on OpenMP-based matrix multiplication, underscoring how thread scheduling and loop collapsing strategies affect cache utilization and scalability. Saikia and Deka~\cite{saikia2018cuda} investigated CUDA kernel optimizations such as shared-memory tiling and loop unrolling, demonstrating that effective utilization of on-chip shared memory significantly reduces global-memory latency. More recently, Li \textit{et al.}~\cite{li2022hybrid} proposed hybrid MPI+CUDA implementations for large-scale matrix operations, illustrating that overlapping communication and GPU computation further enhances scalability across heterogeneous clusters.

While these studies have established significant performance trends, most were constrained to earlier GPU generations or fewer CPU cores. The rapid advancements in compiler optimization, cache hierarchies, and GPU architectures have considerably transformed the performance landscape. Therefore, revisiting these frameworks using modern hardware and toolchains is crucial to acquire current insights into their relative efficiency and scalability. The present study extends prior work by systematically benchmarking OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA implementations on a contemporary heterogeneous platform that integrates a 6-core Intel i5-11400H CPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU.



\section{Experimental Methodology}

All experiments were conducted on a single heterogeneous computing platform equipped with both a multi-core CPU and a discrete GPU. The hardware and software configurations, along with the benchmarking methodology, are described below.

\subsection{Hardware Configuration}
The host system is equipped with an Intel 11th Generation Core i5-11400H processor, featuring six physical cores and twelve hardware threads. It operates at a base frequency of 2.70 GHz, with the capability to reach a turbo boost frequency of up to 4.5 GHz. The CPU supports Hyper-Threading and AVX2 vector instructions. The system is complemented by 16 GB of DDR4 memory and a cache hierarchy comprising 288 KB (L1), 7.5 MB (L2), and 12 MB (L3). The accelerator device is an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU, which includes 4 GB of GDDR6 memory, 2048 CUDA cores, and a memory bandwidth of 224 GB/s. Table~\ref{tab:hardware} provides a summary of the system configuration.

RAM & 16~GB DDR4 \\
Operating System & Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL2 environment) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\subsection{Software Environment}
The experiments were executed under Ubuntu~24.04 running on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). The development and execution environments are summarized below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Compiler and Libraries:} GCC~13.3, OpenMPI~4.1.6, and NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit~12.7
  \item \textbf{Language Standards:} C++17 for CPU codes and CUDA~C++ for GPU implementations
  \item \textbf{Build Commands:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sequential/OpenMP: \texttt{g++ -O3 -march=native -fopenmp}
    \item MPI: \texttt{mpicxx -O3 -march=native}
    \item CUDA: \texttt{nvcc -O3 -arch=sm\_70}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Benchmark Parameters}
Dense square matrices of dimensions $N = \{500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000\}$ were employed in all experimental procedures. Each experiment was conducted five times to mitigate the effects of runtime variability. Arithmetic operations were executed using single-precision floating-point values to ensure consistency across different implementations. A fixed random seed was established using \texttt{srand48(12345)} to facilitate deterministic input generation.

In the OpenMP implementation, the number of threads was varied from 1 to 12 to examine scalability. The MPI implementation was evaluated with 1, 2, 4, and 6 processes to assess distributed-memory scaling. The CUDA experiments encompassed both a manually optimized tiled kernel and the vendor-optimized cuBLAS version; however, due to limitations in the driver and toolkit, only the results from the tiled kernel are presented in this study.

\subsection{Timing and Measurement Methodology}
All CPU-based implementations (Sequential, OpenMP, MPI) were timed using the \texttt{std::chrono::high\_resolution\_clock} utility in C++. GPU implementations were profiled using CUDA event timers to separately record host-to-device transfer (H2D), kernel execution, and device-to-host transfer (D2H) times. The reported GPU runtime represents the sum of all three components unless stated otherwise.

Each experimental configuration was executed under minimal system load to reduce operating system interference. The mean execution time and standard deviation were computed for each matrix size and framework. Numerical correctness across all frameworks was validated by comparing output checksums, which were found to be consistent within a relative tolerance of $10^{-6}$.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
The following metrics were used to analyze and compare performance across frameworks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Execution Time ($T$):} Average wall-clock time per run (in seconds)
  \item \textbf{Speedup ($S$):} $S = T_{seq} / T_{parallel}$, where $T_{seq}$ is the sequential baseline time
  \item \textbf{Parallel Efficiency ($E$):} $E = S / P$, where $P$ is the number of threads or processes
\end{itemize}
These metrics allow direct comparison of scalability and parallel performance across shared-memory, distributed-memory, and GPU-based paradigms.


\section{Implementation Details}

This section describes the implementation methodology for each programming framework used in the study: Sequential, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA. Each implementation was written in C++ and designed to perform dense matrix–matrix multiplication of two square matrices $A$ and $B$, producing the result matrix $C$ where $C = A \times B$. The computation follows the canonical triple-nested loop algorithm.

\subsection{Sequential Baseline}
The sequential implementation serves as the reference for performance comparison. It consists of three nested loops that iterate over matrix indices, computing each element of the result matrix by accumulating the dot product of corresponding row and column vectors:

\begin{lstlisting}
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k)
            sum += A[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
        C[i*N + j] = sum;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

This version executes on a single CPU core and provides the baseline execution time $T_{seq}$ against which all parallel implementations are evaluated.

\subsection{OpenMP Implementation}
The OpenMP version parallelizes the outermost loop using compiler directives to distribute iterations across multiple CPU threads. Parallelization is achieved using the \texttt{\#pragma omp parallel for} directive, as shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for schedule(dynamic)
for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k)
            sum += A[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
        C[i*N + j] = sum;
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Dynamic scheduling was chosen to balance load distribution among threads, especially for large matrices. The number of threads was controlled through the environment variable \texttt{OMP\_NUM\_THREADS}. Thread scalability was studied for 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 threads. Each thread performs independent iterations, minimizing synchronization overhead. 

To verify correctness, the OpenMP implementation's output was validated against the sequential version using an element-wise relative error tolerance of $10^{-6}$.

\subsection{MPI Implementation}
The MPI implementation follows a distributed-memory model, dividing the matrices across multiple processes (ranks). Each process computes a subset of rows of matrix $A$ and broadcasts the relevant data of matrix $B$ to all ranks. The partial results are then gathered on the root process to form the final matrix $C$.

\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Scatter(A, block_size, MPI_FLOAT, A_local, ...);
MPI_Bcast(B, N*N, MPI_FLOAT, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD);

for (int i = 0; i < local_rows; ++i)
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int k = 0; k < N; ++k)
            sum += A_local[i*N + k] * B[k*N + j];
        C_local[i*N + j] = sum;
    }

MPI_Gather(C_local, block_size, MPI_FLOAT, C, ...);
\end{lstlisting}

This block-row distribution ensures that each process performs $\frac{N}{P}$ rows of the computation, where $P$ is the number of processes. Communication time due to broadcasting and gathering partial results was included in total runtime measurements. The MPI implementation was tested for $P = \{1, 2, 4, 6\}$ processes.

\subsection{CUDA Implementation (Tiled Kernel)}
The GPU implementation uses NVIDIA's CUDA programming model with a shared-memory tiled kernel. Each thread block computes a $TILE \times TILE$ submatrix of $C$, where $TILE=32$. Tiles of matrices $A$ and $B$ are loaded into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses and improve data reuse.

\begin{lstlisting}
#define TILE 32
__global__ void matmul_tile(const float* A, const float* B, float* C, int N) {
    __shared__ float As[TILE][TILE];
    __shared__ float Bs[TILE][TILE];
    int row = blockIdx.y * TILE + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * TILE + threadIdx.x;
    float acc = 0.0f;

    for (int t = 0; t < (N + TILE - 1) / TILE; ++t) {
        As[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = (row < N && t*TILE + threadIdx.x < N)
            ? A[row*N + t*TILE + threadIdx.x] : 0.0f;
        Bs[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = (t*TILE + threadIdx.y < N && col < N)
            ? B[(t*TILE + threadIdx.y)*N + col] : 0.0f;
        __syncthreads();
        for (int k = 0; k < TILE; ++k)
            acc += As[threadIdx.y][k] * Bs[k][threadIdx.x];
        __syncthreads();
    }

    if (row < N && col < N)
        C[row*N + col] = acc;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The kernel launch configuration used a two-dimensional grid and block layout:

\begin{lstlisting}
dim3 block(TILE, TILE);
dim3 grid((N + TILE - 1) / TILE, (N + TILE - 1) / TILE);
matmul_tile<<<grid, block>>>(dA, dB, dC, N);
\end{lstlisting}

CUDA event timers measured host-to-device (H2D) copy, kernel execution, and device-to-host (D2H) copy times separately. The GPU tiled kernel was compared against the sequential and OpenMP versions using the same matrix sizes and validated by checksum equivalence.

\subsection{Validation of Numerical Correctness}
All implementations produced numerically consistent results with relative errors below $10^{-6}$. Checksum validation was applied using:
\[
\text{Checksum}(C) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} C[i][j]
\]
Consistency across implementations confirmed that parallelization and floating-point arithmetic did not introduce significant numerical discrepancies.

\end{itemize}





\section{Discussion}

The results obtained from the experiments provide valuable insights into how different parallel programming paradigms perform under modern hardware architectures. While all frameworks aim to reduce execution time by exploiting concurrency, the degree of achievable speedup and efficiency strongly depends on memory hierarchy, communication costs, and the hardware utilization strategy.

\subsection{Scaling Behavior and Amdahl's Law}
The scalability of each framework can be explained using Amdahl's Law, which expresses the theoretical speedup $S(P)$ as:
\[
S(P) = \frac{1}{(1-f) + \frac{f}{P}}
\]
where $f$ is the parallel fraction of the program and $P$ is the number of processing elements. For OpenMP and MPI implementations, experimental results indicate an effective $f$ of approximately 0.85–0.9, as their speedup curves plateau beyond six parallel units. This implies that 10–15\% of execution time remains serial due to synchronization, cache coherence, or communication overhead.

In contrast, the CUDA implementation exhibited an $f$ close to 0.99, reflecting minimal serial bottlenecks. The GPU's massive thread parallelism allows thousands of operations to execute concurrently, effectively hiding latency and maximizing throughput. These observations align with the theoretical predictions of Amdahl's model for highly parallel workloads.

\subsection{Memory Hierarchy and Data Locality}
Memory bandwidth and data locality play a decisive role in matrix multiplication performance. OpenMP threads share the same physical memory space, resulting in contention when multiple threads access overlapping cache lines. For small matrix sizes, cache reuse is high, but for larger matrices, data evictions and memory latency limit scalability. This explains the diminishing returns observed beyond 6–8 threads.

MPI mitigates cache contention by assigning each process a private memory region. However, communication overhead during matrix broadcasting and result gathering offsets this advantage, particularly on single-node systems without high-speed interconnects. This is consistent with the performance drop observed beyond four MPI processes.

On the GPU, data locality is explicitly managed via shared-memory tiling. Each thread block loads submatrices of $A$ and $B$ into shared memory, reusing them across multiple multiply–add operations. This design minimizes global memory accesses and leads to the substantial performance improvement observed. For $N \geq 2000$, global memory latency was effectively hidden by overlapping memory loads with computation.

\subsection{Compute-to-Communication Ratio}
The performance gap between MPI and CUDA can also be attributed to differences in their compute-to-communication ratios. In MPI, each process performs $\mathcal{O}(N^3/P)$ computations but exchanges $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ data during communication. As $P$ increases, communication becomes a larger fraction of total runtime. In contrast, CUDA's communication (H2D/D2H transfers) occurs only once per kernel invocation, and the GPU performs all computation locally. For large $N$, communication accounts for less than 3\% of total GPU time, while in MPI, it exceeds 30\% beyond four processes.

\subsection{Hardware Utilization and Efficiency}
OpenMP and MPI performance are constrained by CPU memory bandwidth and instruction-level parallelism. CPU threads execute at high clock speeds but are limited by memory access latency and shared resources such as caches and memory controllers. The GPU, on the other hand, uses thousands of lightweight threads to hide latency through context switching. This fundamental architectural difference enables GPUs to achieve orders-of-magnitude higher throughput for compute-bound workloads like matrix multiplication.

The GPU's tiled implementation achieved a parallel efficiency of approximately 95\%, indicating excellent utilization of both compute and memory subsystems. OpenMP and MPI achieved efficiencies of 56\% and 55\%, respectively, at their best configurations, reflecting their sensitivity to bandwidth and communication overheads.

\subsection{Energy and Resource Considerations}
Although not directly measured, GPU acceleration is typically more energy-efficient per operation for highly parallel workloads. The RTX~3050 operates within a power envelope of 73~W, while the CPU peaks near 45~W under full load. Given the 600× speedup achieved by the GPU, the energy per completed operation is significantly lower, despite higher instantaneous power draw. Future work will include quantitative analysis using NVIDIA's NVML library and \texttt{nvidia-smi} metrics.

\subsection{Summary of Findings}
The comparative analysis demonstrates clear performance trends across paradigms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item OpenMP scales well on multi-core CPUs but saturates due to shared-memory contention.
  \item MPI scales across processes but suffers from communication latency as process count increases.
  \item CUDA achieves near-ideal scalability by leveraging massive parallelism and explicit shared-memory optimization.
  \item For small workloads, CPU-based methods remain competitive due to lower setup overheads, but for large workloads, GPU acceleration is superior by two to three orders of magnitude.
\end{itemize}

These findings confirm that the choice of parallel framework must align with both problem size and target hardware architecture. GPUs dominate compute-bound workloads, whereas OpenMP and MPI remain effective for moderate problem sizes and hybrid CPU–GPU systems.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

This study presented a comparative performance analysis of three major parallel programming paradigms OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA applied to dense matrix multiplication on a modern heterogeneous platform. Each implementation was developed, executed, and evaluated under identical conditions to ensure fair comparison. The results highlight the trade-offs between shared-memory, distributed-memory, and GPU-accelerated computing in terms of scalability, efficiency, and architectural utilization.

OpenMP provided moderate speedup, reaching up to $5\times$ improvement over the sequential baseline. However, its scalability was limited by shared-memory contention and diminishing cache reuse beyond six threads. MPI achieved comparable performance with a speedup of $3.3\times$ on six processes, but communication overhead restricted efficiency as process count increased. In contrast, the CUDA tiled kernel exhibited exceptional scalability, attaining over $600\times$ speedup for large matrices ($N=2000$–$4000$) with nearly ideal parallel efficiency. These results confirm that GPU-based acceleration delivers the highest performance for compute-bound workloads, primarily due to explicit shared-memory management and massive concurrency.

From an architectural perspective, OpenMP and MPI are constrained by CPU memory bandwidth and synchronization costs, while CUDA exploits high memory bandwidth and fine-grained thread parallelism to fully utilize the GPU. For small workloads, CPU-based parallelism remains competitive due to low launch overhead; however, as workload size grows, GPU acceleration becomes increasingly dominant.

\subsection{Contributions}
The main contributions of this work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A systematic implementation and benchmarking of Sequential, OpenMP, MPI, and CUDA tiled matrix multiplication on identical hardware.
  \item Quantitative evaluation of execution time, speedup, and efficiency across paradigms using a unified methodology.
  \item Empirical validation of Amdahl's Law and its implications on parallel scalability for modern heterogeneous systems.
  \item Demonstration of GPU shared-memory tiling as an effective optimization for dense linear algebra workloads.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Work}
Future extensions of this research will focus on several directions. First, incorporating the vendor-optimized cuBLAS library will allow direct comparison between hand-written kernels and production-grade GPU BLAS implementations. Second, integrating hybrid MPI+CUDA frameworks will enable distributed GPU scaling across multi-node clusters, allowing exploration of strong and weak scaling beyond a single device. Third, profiling energy consumption and thermal characteristics using NVIDIA's NVML and Linux RAPL interfaces will provide insight into performance-per-watt efficiency. Lastly, exploring mixed-precision arithmetic and tensor core acceleration on newer GPUs may further enhance performance for large-scale scientific computations.

\subsection{Closing Remarks}
The results of this study reaffirm the importance of matching computational models to hardware characteristics in high-performance computing. While OpenMP and MPI continue to serve as essential paradigms for CPU-based and distributed workloads, GPU acceleration through CUDA demonstrates transformative performance potential for highly parallel and compute-intensive applications. As heterogeneous computing becomes ubiquitous, understanding and leveraging these paradigms collectively will be key to future HPC system design and application optimization.
